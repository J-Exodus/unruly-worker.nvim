# unruly worker
> a ridiculously fun neovim and tmux workman keyboard layout setup

![unruly worker vim layout cheatsheet](./asset/img/cheatsheet.png)

## LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY
1. When possible, commands are positioned according to the workman layout heatmap. So frequent use will not strain your hands.
2. When possible, commands are arranged onto a semantic key. This makes it possible for the keymap to be remembered with mnemonic phrases.
3. When possible, keys behavior, or behavior substitute, should stay in the same position as the original-keymap, so that there is no need for experienced vim users to unlearn there years of muscle memory.

#### REGISTER PRESELECTION?
With Unruly when you select a register, it stays selected until you change it.
This means you don't select a register for a specific motion, instead you set
the yank or macro register, and then all future yank/paste or record/play
actions will use the selected register until you select a new register. 

## INSTALL AND SETUP
1. Install with your favorite [package manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
2. Add the following **lua** code to your vim config

``` lua
-- Use this setup config if you want to follow the keymap above
local unruly_worker = require('unruly-worker')

-- example setup with default settings
unruly_worker.setup({
  -- you can use the skip_list = {} to stop unruly from creating certain mappings
  -- skip_list = { "z", "Z", "<C-z>"},  skip z related mappings
  skip_list = {},
  booster = {
    quit_easy                   = true,
    scroll_easy                 = true,
    swap_easy                   = true,
    incrament_easy              = true,
    hlsearch_easy               = true,
    lsp_easy                    = true,

    diagnostic_easy             = true,
    diagnostic_leader           = true,
    -- plugin boosters default to false because they all have dependencies
    plugin_navigator            = false,

    plugin_telescope_lsp_leader = false,
    plugin_telescope_jump_easy  = false,
    plugin_telescope_paste_easy = false,
    -- the seek booster is "experimental". it seems to work well but the code
    -- feels a lil hacky... I ran into issues in buffer mode when netrw is open and wrote a 
    -- kinda janky hack to get it to behave the way i wanted it to. (ðŸ¤· works for me)

        },
    },
})
```

#### textobjects select and movement
* `go{object}` goto next outer object
* `gi{object}` goto next inner object
* `ge{object}` goto prev end object
* `Go{object}` goto prev outer object
* `Gi{object}` goto prev inner object
* `Ge{object}` goto prev end object
* `vo{object}` visual outer object
* `vi{object}` visual inner object
* `do{object}` delete outer object
* `di{object}` delete inner object
* `{object}`
  * `a` assigment
  * `b` block
  * `c` call
  * `d` comment (doc)
  * `f` function
  * `i` conditional (if)
  * `l` loop
  * `p` parameter
  * `r` return
  * `s` struct or class

## Unruly Keymap
### CURSOR MOVEMENT
* `yneo` - are mapped to left, down, up, right
* `Y` - goes to beginning of line
* `O` - goes to end of line
B `b` jump to matching brace
* `B` jump cursor to the last place a change was made (back change)
* `gg` - toto top of file
* `GG` - goto end of file
* `t{char}` go to the [count]'th occurance of char to the right
* `T{char}` go to the [count]'th occurance of char to the left
* `h` repeat the last t/T (hop)
* `H` repeat the last t/T reverse (hop reverse)
* `(` prev sentence
* `)` next sentence
* `{` prev paragraph
* `}` next paragraph

### INSERT TEXT
* `i` - Insert
* `I` - Insert at beginning of line
* `a` - Append
* `a` - Append to end of line
* `l` - insert Line below
* `L` - insert Line above

### KOPY/DELETE PASTE
* kopy and paste_kopy use the preselected **kopy_register**. `+` is the default
* delete and paste_delete always use register 0
* kopy and delete share registers 1-9 to track history
* delete has its own pasting keymaps

#### kopy and paste_kopy using the preselected **kopy_register**
* `k` - kopy (yank)
* `K` - kopy line (yank line)
* `p` - paste kopy below
* `P` - paste kopy above
* `"` - select **kopy_register**, `valid registers: [a-z][A-X] and 0 +`
  * press `<enter>` or `<space>` reset to `+`

#### delete and paste_delete using register 0
* `d` delete
* `dd` delete line
* `D` delete to end of line
* `x` delete under cursor
* `X` delete before cursor
* `c` delete then enter insert mode
* `cc` delete line then enter insert mode
* `C` delete to end of line then enter insert mode
* `.` paste_delete below
* `,` paste_delete above

### MACROS
Macros use preselected registers, similar to kopy/paste. By default the macro register
is `'z'`.

* `z` record a macro into the preselected register (default: `'z'`)
* `Z` play a macro from the preselected register
* `<C-z>` select the macro register `valid registers: [a-z][A-Z]`
  * regsiters [0-9] are reserved for the delete register and yank history.
* `<leader>zl` toggle macro recording lock
  * this is useful if you want to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite
  the current macro register
*  `<leader>zp` pretty print the contents of the macro register
It will display special keys like `<enter>`, `<esc>` or `<c-q>`

## MARKS
The unruly idea behind marks is that you only need two marks, for everything
else just use [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim). Unruly marks can be in local buffer mode or global
mode, by default it will be in local mode.

* `<leader>a` set mark a
* `<leader>b` set mark b
* `<C-a>` goto mark a
* `<C-b>` goto mark b
* `m` toggle between local and global mark mode
* `M` clear current mark mode marks
* `[` goto prev jumplist entry (jump history back)
* `]` goto next jumplist entry (jump history forward)

### BUFFER SEARCH
* `/` - search down
* `?` - search up
* `f` - repeat search (find)
* `F` - repeat search reverse (find reverse)

### UTILITY
* `:` or `'` command mode
* `u` undo
* `U` redo
* `<<` shift indent left
* `>>` shift indent right

### WINDOW NAVIGATION
* `<ctrl>w` + `yneo` - are mapped to focus pane left, down, up, right
* `<ctrl>` + `yneo` - are mapped to focus pane left, down, up, right
* `<c-x>` close vim split
* `<c-f>` fullscreen vim split
* `<c-s>` split verticle
* `<c-h>` split horizontal

## ABOUT
Being dyslexic has taught me its often easier for me to build a system for
myself than it is to learn a system that works well for everyone else. This
usually isn't my first approach when trying to learn something new, but when
the struggle is real, I inevitably decide its time to reinvent the wheel. I
think the creation of this keymap is a good example of how my learning style tends to unfold in my life.

After using vim as my only editor for more than 7 years I continued to have
trouble remembering commands. I was proficient enough for my needs, but my
skills plateaued far short of where I wanted them to be. I tried to improve using numerous different tips I found online, but I never quite felt happy with my progress.

Unrelated to vim, I decided to learn the [workman layout](https://workmanlayout.org/).
This decision forced me to consider how to remap a few keys, but one thing lead
to another and eventually I had created an entirely new layout, the
unruly-worker layout. The process of creating this keymap lead to me spending about
a year reading `:help` and scouring the internet for vim config gems. Which
probably seems ridiculous for many people, but for me its just how I've had to
do most things in life. The time feels well used, because I spent the last decade
writing code and I don't plan to stop for many decades to come. Now I've been using
this layout for more than A year at the time of writing this plugin. Unlike
my first 7 years with vim, I can now remember the keymap well enough to experience the
sensation of manipulating the text without noticing that my hands, or
keyboard keys, or even that vim itself has anything to do with it. For me vim
was always the right tool for the job, unruly-worker is just a
[jig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jig_%28tool%29) that makes the tool fit perfectly into my workflow.

Dyslexia may or may not have been what made it so hard for me to learn vim, but
it has normalized the process of reinventing wheels to learn for me. The
unruly-worker layout, is a classic example of the type of outcomes that my
somewhat accidental process produces. A tool that may not be useful for anyone
else, but makes a tool that is useful to many other people accessible to me.
